# WARP_Datasets


Our dataset called WaRP (abbreviation of Waste Recycling Plant) consists
of labeled pictures of an industrial conveyor. We selected 28 recyclable waste
categories. Objects in the dataset are divided into the following groups: plastic bottles of 17 categories (class name with the bottle- prefix),
glass bottles of three types (the glass- prefix), card boards of two categories,
detergents of four categories, canisters and cans. The -full postfix means that
the bottle is filled with air, i.e. not flat. This is important for the correct work
of the manipulator on the conveyor

Examples of instances of each category of the WaRP Dataset are presented
in Figure 3. An important difference from other datasets is that objects can
overlap, be heavily deformed, or be in poor lighting conditions.
The dataset has three parts (see Figure 2): WaRP-D, WaRP-C, and WaRP-S

The first two parts are intended for training and objective quality assessment
of detection (WaRP-D) and classification (WaRP-C) tasks, and the third WaRP-
S is for validation of weakly supervised segmentation method

# Warp-D Detection
The main dataset part WaRP-D contains 2452 images in the training sample
and 522 images in the validation sample. The images have full HD resolution
of 1920 × 1080 pixels.
Each image has ```.txt``` annotation with bboxes.

# Warp-C Classification
WaRP-C is cut-out image areas from the WaRP-D set with class labels.
This part includes 8823 images for training and 1583 for testing. The images
range in size from 40 to 703 pixels wide and 35 to 668 pixels high. The dataset is
unbalanced because iof the real conditions of an industrial enterprise. The rarest
class is the bottle-oil-full (air-filled plastic sunflower oil bottles) category, which
includes only 32 crops. The most common category is bottle-transp (transparent
bottles), with 1667 clipped images.

# Warp-S Segmentation
WaRP-S contains a total of 112 images ranging in size from 100 × 96 pixels
to 412 × 510 pixels, each category has 4 images with significantly deformed
recyclable objects.
